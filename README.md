## About
> A standardized pure functional general purpose programming language. 
> It's one of the most common programming languages with support for lazy computing.
> The type system is complete, strong, static, with automatic type derivation, based on the "Hindley—Milner" type system.
> Since the language is functional, the main control structure is a function.
